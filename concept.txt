The concept is a local-only version control system without the bullshit. This means it can:
  - Stage Changes
  - Commit Changes
  - Create Branches
  - Merge Branches
  - Delete Branches
  - (Be better than git and actually support folders)
  
We could use libFCT4 to store commits. It could also contain commit metadata as a file at the start of the container, or maybe even as a single chunk.
The folder support would require an extension to the FCT4 format.
Branches could easily be realized by just modifying metadata.
